Colony Name (See: Research editor)
Trait editor, requires Def dumper. - implemented, in pre-release
Health editor - inital release will only allow removing health effects unless I figure out a simple way to dump the bodyModel (May have the information I need now)
Research editor - Will add colony name when I get to this.
Scope complete - Polish for final 1.0 release

Any other suggestions
